   <h2>Shopping List</h2>
   <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html">Shopping List</a>
   <p>The goal of this project was to make a shopping list tool that can add items, delete items, and clear all items. I accomplished this by making specific blocks tailored to the purpose of the sprite. Each sprite has a different purpose. A challenge was getting the input to work to delete the numbered items.  I learned how to make blocks with similar, yet different functions.</p>

   <h2>3d Printed Stormtrooper Head</h2>
   <p><a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-death-trooper-32710">3D Printed Stormtooper Head</a>
   <p>The goal of this project is to make a 3D printed stormtrooper helmet and paint it. I accomplished the 3D printing part by downloading a file off Thingiverse. A challenge was printing clear PETG because the melting temperature is very high. I learned how to slice this file properly because I didnâ€™t get it the first try. I still have to sand and paint this model.

   <h2>BJC Snap Drawing App</h2>
   <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=lucky_justice&ProjectName=Drawing%20App%20Improved">Drawing App: "The Big Stroke"</a>
   <p>The goal of this project was to make a simple drawing app that had selectable sizes and colors. There are sliders to adjust the colors as well as the size, allowing for an easy-to-use drawing tool. There's also an eraser tool to fix any mistakes alongide a selection of keyboard shortcuts.</p>
